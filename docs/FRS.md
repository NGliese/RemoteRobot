# Functional Requirement Specification (FRS)

## Introduction

This document elaborates on the functional requirements necessary to fulfill the user requirements defined in the User Requirement Specification (URS) for the robotic system.

## Functional Requirements

### Remote Control (FRS 1)

1. The robotic system shall be equipped with a remote control feature.
2. The remote control interface shall provide the following functionalities:
   - Forward, backward, left, and right movement commands.
   - Start and stop commands for robot movement.
   - Emergency stop functionality.
   - Real-time video feedback from the robot's perspective.
   
### Health Reporting (FRS 2)

1. The robotic system shall continuously monitor its health status.
2. It shall report the following health parameters:
   - Battery level.
   - Sensor status (e.g., lidar, cameras, sensors).
   - System temperature.
   - Connectivity status (e.g., Wi-Fi signal strength).
3. Health reports shall be accessible through a user-friendly web-based dashboard or mobile application.

### Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates (FRS 3)

1. The robotic system shall support Over-the-Air (OTA) software updates.
2. OTA updates shall be initiated remotely and delivered securely.
3. The system shall verify the integrity and authenticity of OTA updates before installation.
4. Users shall have the option to schedule or postpone OTA updates.
5. The system shall provide status notifications during the update process.
6. Upon successful update completion, the system shall automatically reboot and resume normal operation.

### Detection of "Getting Stuck" (FRS 4)

1. The robotic system shall employ a combination of sensors (e.g., obstacle detection, inertial measurement) and algorithms to detect instances of becoming "stuck."
2. When a "getting stuck" scenario is detected, the system shall initiate one of the following actions:
   - Notify the operator/user.
   - Attempt to navigate around the obstacle autonomously.
   - Execute an emergency stop to prevent damage or harm.
   - Log the incident for further analysis.

## Conclusion

This Functional Requirement Specification outlines the specific functional requirements that need to be implemented in the robotic system to meet the user's needs as defined in the User Requirement Specification (URS). These requirements serve as the basis for the design, development, and testing of the system.
