# User Requirement Specification (URS)

## Introduction

This document outlines the user requirements for a robotic system. The system is expected to meet the following key requirements:

## Requirements

### URS 1: Remote Control

- The robot must have the capability to be remotely controlled by an operator or user.
- Remote control should allow users to navigate and command the robot's movements effectively.
- The remote control interface should be user-friendly and intuitive.

### URS 2: Health Reporting

- The robot must be able to provide real-time health status updates.
- It should report vital system information such as battery level, sensor status, and overall operational health.
- Health reporting should be accessible to the operator or user through a user-friendly interface.

### URS 3: Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates

- The robot should support Over-the-Air (OTA) software updates.
- OTA updates should allow for remote and secure software upgrades without requiring physical access to the robot.
- The OTA update process should be reliable and minimize system downtime.

### URS 4: Detection of "Getting Stuck"

- The robot must be equipped with sensors and algorithms to detect instances where it becomes physically stuck or encounters obstacles that impede its movement.
- When a "getting stuck" scenario is detected, the robot should take appropriate actions, such as notifying the operator, attempting to navigate around the obstacle, or stopping its current operation to prevent damage.

## Conclusion

This User Requirement Specification defines the essential requirements for the robotic system. These requirements serve as the foundation for the system's design and development to meet the needs of its users effectively.
