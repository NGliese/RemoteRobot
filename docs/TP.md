# Test Protocol

## Introduction

This document outlines the test cases and procedures to validate that the robotic system meets the functional requirements defined in the Functional Requirement Specification (FRS).

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Remote Control (FRS 1)

**Objective:** To verify the functionality of the remote control feature.

**Procedure:**
1. Ensure the robot is powered on and in a controlled environment.
2. Access the remote control interface.
3. Execute the following remote control commands:
   - Move forward, backward, left, and right.
   - Start and stop robot movement.
   - Emergency stop command.
4. Verify that the robot responds correctly to each command.
5. Check real-time video feedback for clarity and accuracy.
6. Record any anomalies or issues encountered.

**Pass Criteria:** The robot responds accurately to all remote control commands, and video feedback is clear without significant delays or artifacts.

### Test Case 2: Health Reporting (FRS 2)

**Objective:** To validate the health reporting capabilities of the robotic system.

**Procedure:**
1. Power on the robot and allow it to operate.
2. Monitor the health reporting interface for real-time updates.
3. Record the reported health parameters, including battery level, sensor status, system temperature, and connectivity status.
4. Simulate various conditions, such as low battery, sensor failures, and connectivity issues, and verify that the system accurately reports these conditions.
5. Ensure the health reporting interface is accessible through a web-based dashboard or mobile application.

**Pass Criteria:** The system accurately reports health parameters, and the reporting interface is accessible and responsive.

### Test Case 3: Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates (FRS 3)

**Objective:** To test the Over-the-Air (OTA) update functionality.

**Procedure:**
1. Initiate an OTA update from a remote location.
2. Monitor the update process, including download, verification, installation, and reboot phases.
3. Verify that the update is delivered securely and the system validates the update's integrity and authenticity.
4. Ensure that users receive status notifications during the update process.
5. Confirm that the system automatically resumes normal operation after a successful update.

**Pass Criteria:** The OTA update process is completed successfully, and the system resumes normal operation without issues.

### Test Case 4: Detection of "Getting Stuck" (FRS 4)

**Objective:** To test the system's ability to detect and respond to "getting stuck" scenarios.

**Procedure:**
1. Place the robot in various environments with obstacles.
2. Simulate "getting stuck" scenarios by obstructing the robot's path.
3. Observe the system's response to each scenario, including notification to the operator/user, autonomous navigation attempts, emergency stops, and incident logging.
4. Record the system's actions and response times.
5. Verify that the system effectively detects and responds to "getting stuck" situations.

**Pass Criteria:** The system responds appropriately to "getting stuck" scenarios, taking the necessary actions to prevent damage or harm.

## Conclusion

This Test Protocol outlines the test cases and procedures to validate the robotic system's compliance with the functional requirements defined in the Functional Requirement Specification (FRS). The test results will be used to assess the system's readiness for deployment and identify any issues or improvements needed.
