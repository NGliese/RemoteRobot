# Software Validation Risk Analysis

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Wi-Fi Failure

**Description:** The risk of Wi-Fi connectivity issues that may impact the functionality of the system.

**Mitigation:** The system should be designed to operate even with intermittent or limited Wi-Fi connectivity. It should be able to receive and execute commands (cmd) locally without relying on a continuous 100% connection.

### Risk 2: Battery Depletion

**Description:** The risk of the system's battery running out of power during operation, potentially leading to data loss or system failure.

**Mitigation:** The system should continuously monitor the battery level. It must be programmed to proactively stop or enter a low-power state before the battery level reaches a critical point, thereby preventing data loss or unexpected shutdowns.

### Risk 3: Robot Getting Stuck

**Description:** The risk of the robot becoming physically stuck, either due to obstacles, walls, edges, or other environmental factors.

**Mitigation:** The system should incorporate built-in fault detection mechanisms. If the system detects that the robot is stuck or encountering an obstacle that prevents it from moving, it should trigger an appropriate response, such as halting the controller or attempting to navigate around the obstacle.

## Conclusion

This risk analysis document highlights potential risks related to the software validation of the system. The identified risks have corresponding mitigations in place to minimize their impact on the functionality and reliability of the system during operation.
